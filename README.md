# Weather-App

## What is this app?
This is a weather app.

## Who can use this app?
This app can we used for reliable forecast information about weather in different cities. 

## Why was this app created?
This app was created to challenge myself in terms of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## What were the challenges faced during the creation of the app?
I have faced a lot of challenges, which I believe that I overcame. I struggled with the HTML and CSS styling, trying to get the items to be aligned properly on the page. Then I struggled with the JavaScript code.

## How were these challenges overcame?
I have overcame these challenges by spending hours and hours trying to figure out how to deal with each element. I broke down what I knew and what I didn't. I decided to use a simple UI that basically does everything required. I have done a lot of reasearch and testing. After a lot of failures I have managed to create a functional weather app. In terms of JavaScript, I found myself stuck when it came to the creation of dynamic elements. Such as the 5 day forecast boxes, I have had to take a look back at the previous lessons and go step-by-step in creating them and make sure that I link everything correctly.

## Can this app be used by anyone?
Yes, this app can be used by anyone who want's the basics of a weather app with a really minimalistic user interface.
